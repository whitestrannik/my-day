# My Day - Mood and Thoughts Tracker

My Day is a simple, frontend-only React application designed for logging daily moods and brief thoughts. It utilizes browser `localStorage` for data persistence, making it a completely client-side application. The project emphasizes a clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

This application was developed as an exercise in using modern frontend technologies and iterative development practices.

**Live Demo:** [https://whitestrannik.github.io/my-day/](https://whitestrannik.github.io/my-day/) (Once deployed as per instructions below)

    *   Add a short optional note (max 120 characters).
*   **Calendar View:**
