// You can add other global setup code here if needed.
// For example, mocking localStorage if jsdom's isn't sufficient or behaves unexpectedly for some tests,
// though Vitest's jsdom environment usually handles it well.

// Example of clearing localStorage before each test if you find it necessary:
// beforeEach(() => {
//   localStorage.clear();
// });
